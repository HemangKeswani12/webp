                        I believe the energy crisis isn't just a resource problem—it's an engineering challenge waiting for a human-centric solution. My work focuses on the intersection of <strong>sustainable energy management</strong>, specifically harnessing the immense potential of nuclear power, and pioneering space-based energy production systems like Dyson swarms.

                        From the quiet corridors of research institutes to the high-pressure environment of international debates, I've learned that technology without empathy is hollow. Whether I'm redesigning laptop cooling systems to extend hardware lifespans or leading teams to design orbital settlements for 10,000 people, my goal remains the same: to build systems that integrate seamlessly into the fabric of our daily lives, making the complex accessible and the ambitious achievable.

                        Collaborating with the Physics Department at <strong>IISER Pune</strong>, I delved into the complexities of high-energy physics. Our proposal for CERN wasn't just about theoretical particles; it was an attempt to bridge the gap between fundamental physics and practical energy applications.

                        The process involved rigorous networking, interdisciplinary coordination, and a deep dive into the mechanics of the universe. It taught me that the answers to our sustainable energy future might be hidden in the smallest building blocks of matter.

                        At the Asian Regional Space Settlement Design Competition, we weren't just building a model; we were designing a society. As the runner-up team among 150 schools, I led the systems engineering effort for a viable orbital habitat.

                        Balancing the cold, hard constraints of aerospace engineering with the soft, chaotic needs of human psychology, sociology, and economics was a lesson in holistic design. We engineered life support systems, gravity simulation, and social structures, proving that living among the stars requires as much empathy as it does rocket science.

                        Speed is a function of precision. Leading the engineering division for Doppler Racing, I secured the <strong>National Best Engineer Award</strong>. We designed a miniature F1 car that covered 20 meters in just 1.144 seconds.

                        This achievement was the result of months of iterative design, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis, and wind tunnel testing. It wasn't just about making it fast; it was about understanding airflow, reducing drag, and manufacturing with sub-millimeter tolerance.

                        Receiving the Principal's Award Citation was a validation of my belief that you don't have to choose between being a scholar and a leader. This honor recognized a year of consistent excellence across academics, community service, and extracurricular leadership. It stands as a reminder that true impact comes from lifting others up as you climb.

                        Awarded for Outstanding Performance at Asia's largest international UN debate. The topic was space policy—a field where law, ethics, and engineering collide. Defending complex positions on international cooperation in scientific endeavors sharpened my ability to articulate technical concepts to diverse audiences, a skill crucial for any engineer who wants to change the world.
